## Automated Puppet

Automatically capture screenshots of your Home Assistant dashboards on a schedule using Puppeteer. Screenshots are saved to disk and accessible via Home Assistant's local media system.

This is a fork of the [original Puppet add-on](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-addons), redesigned to run as a scheduled background process instead of an HTTP server.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled screenshot capture at configurable intervals
- No open ports (no HTTP server)
- Pre-rendered screenshots for instant access
- E-ink display optimization
- Multiple screenshot configurations with independent schedules
